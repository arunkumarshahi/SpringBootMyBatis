# SpringBootMyBatis
This example demo the integration of Spring Boot with MyBatis.

MyBatis is an open source Java persistence framework that abstracts JDBC boilerplate code and provides a
simple and easy-to-use API to interact with the database.

MyBatis is a SQL mapping framework. It
automates the process of populating the SQL resultset into Java objects and it persists data into tables by
extracting the data from the Java objects.

1. UserMapper.xml - does the mapping between sql column and java object.
2. User - simple pojo class for user entity object.
3. UserMapper - A interface defines the CRUD operation.
